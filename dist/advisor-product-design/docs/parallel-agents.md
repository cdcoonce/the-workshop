# Dispatching Parallel Agents

When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.

Every dispatch here is still subject to the status contract in `core/docs/subagent-development.md`: each agent's reply must end with a `STATUS: <DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT>` line, stay within the 15-line reply cap, and a `BLOCKED` report follows the escalation ladder there — never ignored, never re-dispatched unchanged.

## When to Use

**Use when:**

- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Don't use when:**

- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)
- Need to understand full system state
- Agents would interfere with each other

## The Pattern

### 1. Identify Independent Domains

Group failures by what's broken:

- File A tests: Data validation logic
- File B tests: API response handling
- File C tests: Database connection pooling

Each domain is independent—fixing validation doesn't affect connection pooling.

### 2. Agent Discovery

Scan `.claude/agents/` once, then apply the algorithm from `.claude/docs/agent-matching.md` independently for each parallel task:

- **One scan, multiple matches:** Each parallel task can map to a different agent based on domain and technology — a validation task may match a data-focused agent while an API task matches a backend agent
- **Independent matching:** Apply the full scoring rubric to each task separately; the same agent can match multiple tasks, or different tasks can route to different agents
- **No agents required:** When no `.claude/agents/` directory exists, skip discovery and dispatch all tasks as generic agents

### 3. Create Focused Agent Tasks

Each agent gets:

- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem
- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass
- **Constraints:** Don't change other code
- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed

### 4. Dispatch in Parallel

**Model is required for each dispatch** — an omitted model silently inherits the orchestrator's own model, typically the most capable and most expensive tier. Select a tier per task using the rubric in `.claude/docs/agent-matching.md#model-selection`.

```python
# In Claude Code environment
Task("Fix tests/test_validation.py failures", model={tier})   # required — cheapest | mid | frontier
Task("Fix tests/test_api_responses.py failures", model={tier})
Task("Fix tests/test_db_pool.py failures", model={tier})
# All three run concurrently
```

### 5. Review and Integrate

When agents return:

- Read each summary
- Verify fixes don't conflict
- Run full test suite: `uv run pytest`
- Integrate all changes

## Agent Prompt Structure

Good agent prompts are:

1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain
2. **Self-contained** - All context needed to understand the problem
3. **Specific about output** - What should the agent return?

```markdown
Fix the 3 failing tests in tests/test_data_validation.py:

1. "test_validates_empty_dataframe" - expects ValueError, gets None
2. "test_validates_column_types" - type mismatch on numeric columns
3. "test_validates_date_range" - date parsing fails on edge cases

Your task:

1. Read the test file and understand what each test verifies
2. Identify root cause - logic error or test expectation issue?
3. Fix by:
   - Correcting validation logic if buggy
   - Adjusting test expectations if testing changed behavior

Do NOT just increase timeouts or add workarounds - find the real issue.

Return: Summary of what you found and what you fixed.
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                    | Fix                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Too broad: "Fix all the tests"             | Specific: "Fix tests/test_validation.py"             |
| No context: "Fix the error"                | Context: Paste error messages and test names         |
| No constraints: Agent refactors everything | Constraints: "Fix tests only" or "Don't change API"  |
| Vague output: "Fix it"                     | Specific: "Return summary of root cause and changes" |

## When NOT to Use

- **Related failures:** Fixing one might fix others—investigate together first
- **Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing entire system
- **Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet
- **Shared state:** Agents would edit same files or use same resources

## Verification

After agents return:

1. **Review each summary** - Understand what changed
2. **Check for conflicts** - Did agents edit same code?
3. **Run full suite** - `uv run pytest`
4. **Spot check** - Agents can make systematic errors
