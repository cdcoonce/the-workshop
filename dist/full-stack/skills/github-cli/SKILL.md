  GitHub CLI (gh) integration for managing issues, pull requests, branches,
  commits, and code reviews directly from the terminal. Use when Claude needs to
  create, list, view, or update GitHub issues; create draft branches and
  pull requests; make commits and push changes; review pull request diffs and
  changes; approve or merge PRs; manage GitHub Actions workflows; or work with
  GitHub repositories without switching to a browser. Requires gh CLI installed
  and authenticated.

# GitHub CLI (gh) Skill

Use the `gh` CLI to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and Actions workflows from the terminal.

## Prerequisites

Verify gh is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh --version
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated, run `gh auth login` and follow prompts.

## Core Workflows

### Issue Management

```bash
# List issues
gh issue list                              # Open issues in current repo
gh issue list --state all                  # All issues including closed
gh issue list --assignee @me               # Issues assigned to you
gh issue list --label "bug"                # Filter by label

# Create issue
gh issue create -t "Title" -b "Description"
gh issue create -t "Title" --label "bug" --milestone "milestone-1"
gh issue create                            # Interactive mode

# View/update issue
gh issue view 123                          # View issue details
gh issue view 123 --web                    # Open in browser
gh issue edit 123 --add-label "in-progress"
gh issue close 123
gh issue reopen 123

# Add comments
gh issue comment 123 -b "Working on this now"
```

### Branch & Commit Workflow

```bash
# Create feature/fix branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git checkout -b fix/issue-123
git checkout -b draft/wip-experiment

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue #123"

# Push branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

### Pull Request Management

```bash
# Create PR (multiple methods)
gh pr create                               # Interactive mode
gh pr create --fill                        # Auto-fill from commits
gh pr create --draft                       # Create as draft
gh pr create --draft --fill                # Draft with auto-fill
gh pr create -t "Title" -b "Description" --base main
gh pr create --label "review-needed" --assignee @me

# List PRs
gh pr list                                 # Open PRs
gh pr list --assignee @me                  # Your PRs
gh pr list --reviewer @me                  # PRs requesting your review
gh pr list --draft                         # Draft PRs only

# View PR details
gh pr view 45                              # View PR in terminal
gh pr view 45 --web                        # Open in browser
```

### Code Review Workflow

```bash
# Checkout PR locally for testing
gh pr checkout 45                          # Checkout PR branch locally

# Review changes
gh pr diff 45                              # View PR diff
gh pr diff                                 # Diff for current branch's PR

# Add review comments
gh pr review 45 --comment -b "LGTM, minor suggestion on line 42"
gh pr review --comment -b "Please add tests"  # Comment on current branch's PR

# Approve
gh pr review 45 --approve

# Merge
gh pr merge 45                             # Interactive merge
gh pr merge 45 --squash                    # Squash merge
gh pr merge 45 --rebase                    # Rebase merge
gh pr merge 45 --auto                      # Auto-merge when checks pass
```

### Update Existing PR

```bash
gh pr edit 45 --title "New title"
gh pr edit 45 --body "Updated description"
gh pr edit 45 --base develop
gh pr edit 45 --add-label "ready-for-review"
gh pr ready 45                             # Mark ready (remove draft)
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Management

```bash
# List workflow runs
gh run list                                # Recent workflow runs
gh run list --status failure               # Failed runs only

# View run details
gh run view                                # Current branch run
gh run view 12345                          # Specific run

# Trigger workflow
gh workflow run ci.yml                     # Run workflow on current branch
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref feature/x    # Run on specific branch

# Re-run failed jobs
gh run rerun 12345                         # Re-run workflow
gh run rerun 12345 --failed-only           # Re-run only failed jobs

# View run logs
gh run watch 12345                         # Watch running workflow
gh run view 12345 --log                    # View full logs

# View workflow status
gh run list --branch main                  # Runs on specific branch
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="ghp_xxxx"                # Personal access token

export GH_REPO="owner/repo"               # Default repository
```

## Tips & Gotchas

### Multi-line Descriptions with Markdown

When creating issues or PRs with long descriptions containing markdown (code blocks, backticks), avoid heredocs which can fail due to shell interpretation. Instead:

```bash
# Step 1: Write description to a temp file (outside bash)
# Step 2: Create from the temp file
gh issue create -t "Title" -b "$(cat temp_description.txt)"
# Step 3: Clean up
rm temp_description.txt
```

This avoids issues with:

- Backticks in code blocks conflicting with command substitution
- Special characters being interpreted by the shell
- Heredoc delimiter conflicts

### Sourcing Description from Existing Files

To create an issue or PR from a markdown plan file:

```bash
# Read file contents into description
gh issue create -t "Title" -b "$(cat docs/plans/my-plan.md)"
gh pr create -t "Title" -b "$(cat docs/plans/my-plan.md)"
```
