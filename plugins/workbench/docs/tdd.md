# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## When to Use

**Always:**

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Behavior changes

**Exceptions (ask first):**

- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code
- Configuration files

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED - Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

```python
def test_retries_failed_operations_three_times():
    attempts = []

    def operation():
        attempts.append(1)
        if len(attempts) < 3:
            raise RuntimeError("fail")
        return "success"

    result = retry_operation(operation)

    assert result == "success"
    assert len(attempts) == 3
```

**Requirements:**

- One behavior per test
- Clear, descriptive name
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

### Verify RED - Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_retry.py -v
```

Confirm:

- Test fails (not errors)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because feature missing (not typos)

### GREEN - Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test.

```python
def retry_operation(fn, max_retries: int = 3):
    """Retry an operation up to max_retries times."""
    for i in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return fn()
        except Exception:
            if i == max_retries - 1:
                raise
```

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.**

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_retry.py -v
```

Confirm:

- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

### REFACTOR - Clean Up

After green only:

- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers

Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

## Good Tests

| Quality     | Good                                | Bad                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Minimal** | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `test_validates_email_and_domain_and_whitespace` |
| **Clear**   | Name describes behavior             | `test_1`, `test_it_works`                        |
| **Real**    | Tests actual code                   | Tests mocked behavior                            |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse                         | Reality                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too simple to test"           | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds.          |
| "I'll test after"              | Tests passing immediately prove nothing.            |
| "Already manually tested"      | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run.       |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is debt. |
| "TDD will slow me down"        | TDD faster than debugging.                          |

## Example: Bug Fix

**Bug:** Empty email accepted

**RED**

```python
def test_rejects_empty_email():
    result = submit_form({"email": ""})
    assert result["error"] == "Email required"
```

**Verify RED**

```bash
$ uv run pytest tests/test_form.py::test_rejects_empty_email -v
FAILED: AssertionError: assert None == 'Email required'
```

**GREEN**

```python
def submit_form(data: dict) -> dict:
    if not data.get("email", "").strip():
        return {"error": "Email required"}
    # ...
```

**Verify GREEN**

```bash
$ uv run pytest tests/test_form.py -v
PASSED
```

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases covered

## When Stuck

| Problem                | Solution                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Ask for help.         |
| Test too complicated   | Design too complicated. Simplify.           |
| Must mock everything   | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection. |

## Final Rule

```
Production code → test exists and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```
